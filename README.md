# Angular-SQL
This app allows an AngularJS website to retrieve data from SQL database


Description

This is a MVC php app with client-side (view) written in AngularJS. Data is fetched from MySQL server via php. 
The data is sent to the client side through AJAX. There is a javascript code in which controllers of AngularJS send data to the view and respond to user input.
The data is received through AJAX to the view so it does not interfere with other processes. 

This app is creative in that it implements MVC design on both server side and client side. It also harnesses the useful AJAX technique.

Site structure
